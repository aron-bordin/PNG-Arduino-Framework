This is the documentation of .PNG Arduino Framework. This Framework was developed by students of Unesp - University of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, with the goal to turn Arduino project development easier. The framework has a chain of modular classes, compatible with some Arduino components. 
We'll be extending it to more components when possible. 
If you like this project, please take a look on `how to support us`__.
